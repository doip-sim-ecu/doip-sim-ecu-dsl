        logicalAddress = 0x1010
        functionalAddress = 0xcafe

        // Optional: Define the network interface the gateway should bind to
        // For multiple gateways, you could run a container with multiple ips, and bind each gateway to one of them

        // You can now define how requests for the gateway should be handled

        // Generally speaking there are 2 types of request matching
        // 1. Exact matches - they are done by binary matching and aren't limited in length
        //    They are always done when there's no variable content in the "pattern"
        // 2. Regular expressions - incoming requests are converted into normalized hex-strings (uppercase,
        //    no whitespaces), which then are matched against a regular expression defined in the request argument.
        //
        // If a string (instead of a Regex) is given, it's first converted into a Regex by removing the spaces,
        // converting it to uppercase and replacing [] with .* to be matched against the normalized request string
        //
        // Matching order is always the order in which the requests are defined. This might be changed in the future.
        //
        // Since converting all incoming request bytes would be fairly expensive (esp. to simulate flashing),
        // the amount of converted bytes for matching with regular expressions is limited to the value set by
        // requestMatchBytes here (default 10).
        // Note: This means any regular expression containing more bytes than requestRegexMatchBytes will NEVER match
        requestRegexMatchBytes = 10

        // Now, let's see some Exact matches examples:
        // To start off, let's use a simple example, let's acknowledge the presence of a tester
        request("3E 00") { ack() }
        // This is semantically exactly the same as
        request("3E 00") { respond("7E 3E") }
        // As well as
        request(byteArrayOf(0x3E, 0x00)) { respond(byteArrayOf(0x7E, 0x3E)) }

        // We can also define a name for the request, which might be used in logging in the future
        request("3E 00", "TesterPresent") { ack() }

        // It's also possible to send nrc's
        request("3E 00") { nrc() }
        // Which is semantically the same as
        request("3e 00") { nrc(NrcError.GeneralReject) }
        // And again
        request("3E 00") { respond("7F 3E 10") }
        // As well as
        request(byteArrayOf(0x3E, 0x00)) { respond(byteArrayOf(0x7F, 0x3E, 0x10)) }

        // The matching can also be done with regular expressions, by either using a string which will be
        // converted into a (hopefully correct) regular expression, or by specifying a Regex
        // directly

        // The regular expression conversion will replace the characters [] with .*, convert the expression to
        // uppercase and remove all spaces

        // So this expression
        request("3e 00 []") { ack() }
        // is semantically the same as
        request(Regex("3E00.*")) { ack() }

        // For more complex matching you'd typically use a Regex-object, but for most cases in practice the string
        // with the [] placeholder work well enough.


        // At this point you could also programmatically open a csv-file, instead of defining each request,
        // read in a list of requests and responses, to transform them into request(..) { respond(...) } pairs.

        // But since csv-files are static, where's the fun in that?
        // Since everything in between {} is a lambda function that'll be executed when the request matches,
        // we can actually do useful things - as an example, let's maintain an ecu session state machine
        var ecuSession = SessionState.DEFAULT
        request("10 01") { ack(); ecuSession = SessionState.DEFAULT }
        request("10 02") { ack(); ecuSession = SessionState.PROGRAMMING }
        request("10 03") { ack(); ecuSession = SessionState.DIAGNOSTIC }
        request("10 04") { ack(); ecuSession = SessionState.SAFETY }

        // Now, let's say we can only HardReset if we're in the PROGRAMMING session
        request("11 01", "HardReset") {
            if (ecuSession == SessionState.PROGRAMMING) {
                ack()
            } else {
                nrc(NrcError.SecurityAccessDenied)
            }
        }

        // State checking could also be done with an extension function that uses the state, now every conditioned
        // response can just use the extension function to save you time from writing plenty of redundant code
        fun RequestResponseData.respondIfProgramming(response: RequestResponseHandler) {
            if (ecuSession == SessionState.PROGRAMMING) {
                response.invoke(this)

                nrc(NrcError.SecurityAccessDenied)
            }
        }
        // Let's do this for the soft reset, as well as the key off on reset
        request("11 03") { respondIfProgramming { ack() } }
        request("11 02") { respondIfProgramming { ack() } }

        // Now we all know that an ecu doesn't respond while rebooting, that's something we can simulate too,
        // by using an interceptor. Interceptors run before all request matching and are described below
        request("11 01", "HardReset") {
            ack()
            addEcuInterceptor("WaitWhileRebooting", 4000.milliseconds) { req ->

                    this.message[0] == 0xFF.toByte() ||
                    this.request.message[0] == 0xFF.toByte()) {
                    // This case won't ever happen, just to show what's possible in this context
                    ack()
                    // You could respond in the same ways as shown in the gateway examples
                }

                // When true is returned, all request matching is forfeited, and no matching will
                // be executed. When all interceptors return false, the normal request matching will
                // commence afterwards
                true

                // This is also a pretty powerful tool for testing - you could start an interceptor that records all
                // calls to an ecu with an uds request (or run REST-webservices on a different port for this),
                // return all recorded calls with another one and use a third one to delete the
                // data/stop the interceptor. This enables you to text the exact commands/messages sent to the ecu
                // in an integration test.
            }
        }

        // To integration-test code that uses this simulated ecu, we could define a custom write-service with
        // a parameter, which could introduce specific error conditions through state, until reset by a
        // different parameter

        // Misc. commands:

        // You can also decide to not handle it in this handler and continue calling other matches by calling continueMatching()
        request("3E 00") { if (true) continueMatching() }

        // You can also set and replace timers -
        // e.g. to reset your session to default when no tester present was sent in 5 seconds
        request("3E 00") {
            ack()

        // If we do it that way, we actually have a hard time resetting the ecu into a defined initial state.
        // To get around this, you can save state in a storage container associated with the ecu or request, which are
        // persistent across different requests (ecu), or within multiple consecutive requests (caller)
        //
        // These storages are reset, when the reset() method is called on the ecu or request

            }
            ack()
            // this session state is persisted for the ecu, so if you get it in another request, the last
            // set value will be the current one (until reset is called)

            // We can also do this on the request level by using caller instead of ecu
            var requestCounter: Int by caller.storedProperty { 0 }
            requestCounter++
            // It's named "caller", because the exact same concept also applies to interceptors
